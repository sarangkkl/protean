    The three methods in this baseclass to `add`, `get` or `remove` entities are sufficient in most cases
    to handle application requirements. They have built-in support for handling child relationships and
    honor Unit of Work constructs. While they can be overriddent, it is generally suggested to call the
    parent method first before writing custom code.

    Repositories are strictly meant to be used in conjunction with Aggregate elements. While it is possible
    to link and use :ref:`user-entity`, it is always better to deal with persistence at the level of the transaction
    boundary, which is at the aggregate's level.

        Protean adopts a collection-oriented design pattern to handle persistence. What this means is that
        the Repository interface does not hint in any way that there is an underlying persistence mechanism,
        avoiding any notion of saving or persisting data in the design layer. The task of syncing the data
        back into the persistence store is handled automatically.

        To be specific, a Repository mimics a `set` collection. Whatever the implementation, the repository
        will not allow instances of the same object to be added twice. Also, when retrieving objects from
        a Repository and modifying them, you don’t need to “re-save” them to the Repository.

        If there is a :ref:`Unit of Work <unit-of-work>` in progress, then the changes are performed on the
        UoW's active session. They are committed whenever the entire UoW is committed. If there is no
        transaction in progress, changes are committed immediately to the persistence store. This mechanism
        is part of the DAO's design, and is automatically used wherever one tries to persist data.
